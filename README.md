## Overview of Project:
Our team has been scouted by the phenomenal journalist named Dana. She has requested our team to prepare a visualization of the UFO data she had compiled.

We completed her request by not only designing a website. We were also able to filter the webpage to include options!

Example Enter Date, Enter a City, Enter a State, Enter a Country and Enter a Shape! We have thought of it all for Dana's project (previewed only) 

### Webpage Preview and Summary ###

## Summary:
###  Future Improvements ### 
Our team would love to take this from a preview to an interactive experience. Although we have nailed the UX, we would love to work with a team to bring the UI up a notch to match our hard work! Although we are already off to a fantastic start.
